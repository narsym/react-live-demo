#React live demo 

To view the website live see here: https://narsym.github.io/react-live-demo/

All the project is developed using React js.
There is a single page. According to the content it changes. (Client side rendering)

For ex: If we press About in navbar, About content loads.

Any suggestions to improve the project is most welcome.
